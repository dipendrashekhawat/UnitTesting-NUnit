# Add Days to Date Program with Unit Testing - C#, NUnit

This is a simple program which adds number of days to the given date and displays the new date with the days added. 
The idea came to me when I had to add 240 days to a date for calucating my eligibility to received one award.

Using [Test] attribute we can write our test cases to be executed by the Test runner.
